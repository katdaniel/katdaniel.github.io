		<div class="text"><p>Heya, I'm a musician from Sweden who makes indie folk/ambient/pop stuff. I'm mainly inspired by Elliott Smith, Radiohead, Syd Matters, Belle & Sebastian, and the likes of them. Hope you enjoy!
<br/><br/>	I'm currently working on my third album called "Hallå, Kära Flod" (previously named midnight songs). It's in the same vain as First Orchid but more thought out, developed, and mature. Both lyrically and musically. For the first time I'm also releasing singles, so far one of them is out. Take a listen to White Chalk in a Sea of Ink on either bandcamp or youtube.</p>
	Also working on a short album called "Moontapes" with my friend from Italy, Daffon.
